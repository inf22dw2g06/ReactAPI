# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Work on Authentication and Authorization in a RESTful Web API

### Introduction
Hello everyone! We are Rafael, Jesus, and Rafael Fernandez, and we have organized this project for the subject of Web API implementation with authentication and authorization using a MySQL Database. The objective of this project is to develop a ReactJS Web Client Application that connects to a RESTful Web API protected by authentication and authorization layers.

### Part 1: Implementation of the RESTful Web API
In the first part of this project, our focus was on implementing a RESTful Web API that utilizes authentication and authorization layers to control access to resources in a MySQL Database. For this purpose, we have chosen a REST API related to Pokémon, which allows us to perform operations such as querying and manipulating data related to these characters.

### Part 2: Development of the ReactJS Web Client Application
The second part of this project involves developing a ReactJS Web Client Application that enables access to and querying of resources provided by the RESTful Web API implemented in the first part. The application should be able to interact with the API, authenticate properly, and obtain appropriate permissions to perform desired operations.

Since we have selected a Pokémon-related REST API, the client application will be designed to display information about different types of Pokémon, their abilities, characteristics, and other relevant data. Additionally, authentication and authorization mechanisms will be implemented to ensure that only authorized users can access and manipulate the Pokémon-related data.
